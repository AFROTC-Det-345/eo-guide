**SURVIVAL TIMELINE**

**July – August**

- Review instructor schedule for the fall semester.
  - Verify that every class has an instructor
  - Verify instructors allot for alternate classes & that there is documentation on file approving alternate classes from the Det CC
  - If there are distance learning classes, verify there is an approval letter on file from the Region Commander and Holm Center Curriculum (CR) Director.
  - If Professional Officer Course (POC) instruction is offered on an alternate-year basis, verify there is an approved waiver
- In-Service Training (IST)
  - Ensure each cadre member completes monthly ISTs and document it on the form given by AFROTC on TEAMS.
- Review syllabi for Fall Term
  - Review the syllabi for each APAS (recommend using a "syllabus checklist") to ensure all syllabi meet the requirements of AETC and the host university
- Calculate Grade Point Average (GPA) for new cadets
  - Verify new cadets meet GPA requirements, if they completed college courses. Cadets must turn in transcripts for any college courses taken, including dual-enrollment in high school.
- Conditional Events (CE) and AFROTC Form 16, _Officer Candidate Counseling Record_, for academic performance
  - Make sure each APAS and Det CC knows which cadets did not meet academic standards during the previous term and ensure they are ready to issue a CE (contract cadets) or AFROTC Form 16 (non-contract).
- Miscellaneous
  - Regardless of how many credit hours a cadet has, AFROTC will determine a cadet an AS 100 (four year cadet) vs AS 250 (three year cadet) based on their projected graduation date.
  - Review the results of the End-of-Term Surveys & appropriately place any info from there into syllabi
  - Conduct instructor evaluations (see instructor evaluation section) or delegate a certified instructor to evaluate another cadre member
  - Ensure every cadre member has a Form 2982 on file.
  - Build Instructor Folders for PAS and all APAS (include training certificates, evaluations, Master Instructor logs, test, syllabi, etc.).
  - If available, attend Faculty Development Training provided by your host university. Reach out to see times & if there is a CBT to do in its place.
  - If possible, discuss the AFROTC Form 48, Planned Academic Program, with the University's Academic Advising Office
    - This form can be confusing to many academic advisors. If the university does not have an advising officer or annual advising conference, try to make an appointment with the individual departments from which a bulk of your students come (such as engineering, foreign language, nursing, etc.).
    - This will help foster a good relationship for crosstown community college students. A signed form 48 or academic plan is needed from a four year university. The EO will help explain the justification to academic advisors and inform them that it is not acceptance but rather an item needed for AFROTC to ensure cadets will be projected to graduate on a certain date to meet contractual obligations.
  - Textbook Order
    - No physical textbooks are required. As all APAS/PAS instructors will use WINGS for curriculum guidance. DVDs with curriculum will also be provided every summer.

**August – September**

- Resolve registration issues. Cross-town students sometimes experience difficulty with the registration process. Make sure cadets are resolving problems when required.
- Have cadets turn inform 48s shortly after school starts, recommended no more than 4 weeks. This helps cadre to ensure the cadet can be in the program and properly classify them.

**October**

- Wrap up fall term counseling (ensure cadre have completed sessions for all of their respective cadets).
- AFROTC Form 48s (applies to all instructors)
  - Ensure ALL cadets have a completed AFROTC Form 48 on file, especially any contract cadets. Verify Date of Commission (DOC)/Date of Graduation (DOG) through the Student Management Roster (SMR) & their SURF.

**November**

- Prepare syllabi for next semester and ensure instructors have begun theirs to turn in to the EO for review

**December**

- Transcripts
  - Request/obtain from all universities and/or cadets. Recommend having a google drive folder for cadets to drop their crosstown transcripts.
  - Review transcripts and identify scholarship actions (i.e. low GPA leads to academic CE or scholarship suspension)
  - Recalculate cross-town and transfer student GPAs (can wait until January).
  - Annotate scholarship actions via AFROTC Form 16 (conditionals, suspensions, terminations, reactivations).
  - Update WINGS
- Textbook Order
- Review End-of-Term Surveys and compile data for each instructor. Each instructor should be reviewing their own, while EO should present it as whole for future best practices.

**December – January**

- Conduct review of instructor exams, gradebooks and upcoming spring term syllabi
- Conduct records review (may not be EFC duty; really up to detachment on when and how often)
  - Pay close attention that Form 16s for each term for each cadet are signed. Verify AFROTC Form 48s are filled out correctly. Ensure all transcripts are on file. Check for any CEs that should have been issued.
  - May want to incorporate record reviews with IST so cadre can focus on certain areas of the cadet record each month versus reviewing each in its entirety.

**January**

- Complete July through September actions (as necessary).

**March**

- Recommend conducting instructor evaluations, if not completed already (must be completed once per semester)
  - Wrap up spring term counseling (ensure cadre have completed sessions for all of their respective cadets).

**April**

- Summer Classes
  - The Detachment Commander may schedule summer AFROTC classes including tutorial classes/independent study when circumstances prevent students from enrolling in courses during the regular term (i.e. study abroad). Attendance records must be maintained and documentation must be retained to clearly demonstrate how the appropriate AS lesson objectives were presented.

**May**

- Transcript
  - Request from all universities (except Quarter Schools) & crosstown cadets as needed
  - Review and identify scholarship actions.
  - Recalculate cross-town and transfer student GPAs
  - Annotate scholarship actions via Form 16 (conditionals, suspensions, terminations, reactivations).
  - Update WINGS
- Conduct review of instructor exams and gradebooks
- Review End-of-Term Surveys and compile data for each instructor. Prepare to present findings at a gathering such as staff meeting.

**June**

- Conduct records review (not solely EO duty)
  - Pay close attention that there are AFROTC Form 16s for each term for each cadet. Verify AFROTC Form 48s are filled out correctly. Ensure all transcripts are on file. Check for any CEs that should have been issued.
  - May want to incorporate record reviews with IST so cadre can focus on certain areas of the cadet record each month versus reviewing each in its entirety

**July**

- Recommend uniformed members complete ancillary annual training during the summer to free time during the school year.
- Ensure all cadre are up-to-date on PTL-B & CPR training prior to school start.
- Brief Detachment Commander on university's policies on maintaining academic records and required instructor training that is more demanding than AFROTC requirements.
  - Because this is a checklist item, the best way to show you have accomplished this is to draft a memo containing the host university's policy (do not worry about policies of cross-towns) and have the Detachment Commander sign it. Place it in your continuity binder.
  - Be sure to brief other cadre on these policies.

**INSTRUCTOR EVALUATIONS**

The EO is responsible for making sure the Detachment Commander and all APASs (including the EO) are evaluated each academic year for teaching effectiveness and are documented on the AETC Form 13. The EO will ensure all cadre instructors are evaluated by the EO or another certified instructor. If the Detachment Commander is the EO, he or she will be evaluated by any qualified instructor in the detachment as directed by the Detachment Commander. Reference AFROTC 36-2011, Cadet Operations and HOLMCENTERI 36-2601, Faculty Development and Master Instructor Programs, for more information.

- Ask each instructor to look over their lessons for the semester and pick the lesson they would like you to evaluate. Recommend completing at the beginning of the semester.
  - If an instructor is rated "Unqualified" in any item, the EO will ensure the instructor receives appropriate remedial training. Additionally, the Detachment Commander or EO may conduct another evaluation within 30 days. The evaluator will comment specifically on that area during the next evaluation.
  - If an instructor is rated "Unqualified," the evaluator may recommend decertification to the Detachment Commander. The PAS can decertify the instructor and relieve the instructor of his/her duties. At a minimum, the instructor should be temporarily relieved of instructor duties for immediate remedial training. Prior to recertification, the instructor must present a lesson to the PAS and it must be documented in the instructor's file
- Documentation
  - Provide original evaluation to the instructor and place a copy in the instructor's training record.
  - Document with a MFR if the instructor cannot be evaluated during an entire semester (i.e. at PME, extended medical leave, deployed, etc.) and put the MFR in place of the Form 13 in the instructor's folder.
- Tips
  - Inspectors will look over forms for constructive feedback on the forms; there is always room for improvement. Recommend providing specific feedback on items. Be specific on what they did well and how they can improve.
  - Invite SAV team members to conduct an evaluation of one of the APASs if possible.
  - If your school has an office dedicated to building better professors (i.e. Center for Teaching Excellence), invite one of their staff to evaluate the class.

**APAS / ACADEMIC INSTRUCTOR COURSE OUT-OF-CYCLE REQUIREMENTS**

IAW AFROTCI 36-2011, Cadet Operations, the EO will ensure new instructors who did not attend either the Academic Instructor Course (AIC) or the Detachment Commander Course are familiar with AFROTC educational principles and policies presented during the most recent summer's program. Use handouts from a recent attendee or contact Holm Center/CR for student materials. Document training and retain in the Instructor Folder until the instructor attends the appropriate course, receives a waiver, or is reassigned. The instructor is authorized to instruct only in the presence of a certified instructor.

- Use the Mission Qualification Training to include some topics such as: Operating Instructions, Foundations of Teaching, Teaching Techniques, Evaluation, HQ Holm Center Information, and HQ ROTC and Unit Information.
- Refer to HOLMCENTERI 36-2601 for information on who is eligible for an AIC waiver and paragraph 2.4 for an AIC deferral and how to submit the request. If an instructor has a waiver or deferral, make sure a copy is in their instructor folder in place of the AIC certificate.

**IST SESSIONS**

TheEOisresponsibleforthedetachmentISTprogramandwilldetermine,schedule,anddocumentallISTs per AFROTC policy.YouwillfindslideshowpresentationsontheTEAMS in areas such as:

- AFROTC Training Procedures & Policies in the HCTM
- New Student Orientation Program Best Practices
- Cadet Pay
- Master Instructor Badge Requirements
- HSSP Interviews
- Documentation
  - AFROTC instructions require you to save IST rosters until the end of the calendar year following the previous academic year. You should save all rosters between inspection periods to show all topics covered.
- Tips
  - You may want to incorporate record reviews with IST so cadre can focus on certain areas of the cadet record each month versus reviewing each in its entirety.

**FACULTY DEVELOPMENT & ACADEMIC ENHANCEMENT (Faculty Enrichment Section, University Sponsored Faculty Development**

At each college and university, there are a myriad of resources available to faculty members. To the maximum extent possible, the EO must seek out and provide ways to enhance and enrich the development of all instructors and their courses. Ideas are shown below

- Attending university or college sponsored faculty development seminars.
- Work with the faculty development office. Invite members of the office for a brown bag lunch to pick their brains for information.
- Speak to your school's distance learning/on-line course administrators to learn more about ways to enhance your classroom.

**INSTRUCTOR FOLDERS**

IAW HOLMCENTERI 36-2601, the EO will file instructor training and evaluation folders, to include AETC Form 13s, in the Instructor Training Folder/binder as applicable. Recommend using a six part folder to maintain documents.

- Documentation
  - The folder must include a variety of items seen below. Upon leaving the unit, the EO will give the instructor his/her training and evaluation documentation.
  - 6.2. AFROTC Training and Evaluation Folders (TEFs). The detachment EO will manage and file faculty Professional Development and evaluation data, to include AIC diploma/IQT Certification, deferral or waiver, MQT, JQS (NCOs Only) or individual assessments (Det/CC/APAS Only) documented on the Form 13, Air Force Mandated Ancillary Training, and In-Service Training (IST) completion. Detachments will give faculty members their professional development and evaluation documentation upon final out-processing from the unit.
- Tips
  - Recommend you also maintain the syllabi, exams, IST attendance, grade books, EOT surveys, training certificates, etc. in this folder as well as the standard maintenance location.

**MASTER INSTRUCTOR BADGE**

IAWHOLMCENTERI36-2601,Chapter8,theMasterInstructorProgramisdesignedtorewardinstructorsorinstructorsupervisors,militaryandcivilian,whohavedevelopedthemselvesbeyondthenormalrequirementsofaninstructoranddisplayexemplaryinstructionalperformance.Thecriteriaforachievingmasterinstructorareacombinationofteachingexperience,anacademicdegree,continuingeducation,professionalprojects,instructorawards,andteachingevaluations.SeeChapter8fordetailsonhowtocomplete.

- Tips
  - Brief requirements so instructors know what the program entails. It is a comprehensive process and cannot be completed in a few months. Make sure any instructor who wants to earn the badge starts early! Consider building a checklist to give to instructors interested in completing the program.

**TEXTBOOK MANAGEMENT**

As the EO, you are responsible to ensure all instructors have all required educational materials prior to the start of each semester. Even with e-curriculum, there are certain educational materials that the EO can order through WINGS. When you receive shipments of educational materials, you will need to acknowledge receipt of the materials in the WINGS inventory system. (NOTE: There are no DVDs available to replace Master DVDs previously shipped)

- You can always download lessons from Holm Center WINGS
- If an instructor is not using an item in the inventory, you talk to your ITAM primary to rid the item.
- Instructors CANNOT require cadets to purchase commercial texts for an AFROTC course.
- Tips
  - Recommend having instructors or EO hold onto DVDs at the beginning of each term.

**SYLLABI**

TheEOisrequiredtoreviewthesyllabusforeachinstructoreachterm.AFROTCI36-2010, _Cadet Training Programs_,outlinestheitemsrequiredtobeinthesyllabusbyAFROTC.Thehostinstitutionmayhavesyllabusrequirementsaswell,sobesuretocheckforthosetoo.AFROTCrequirementsinclude:

- Attendance policy for cadets (80% minimum). Policy must also specify attendance requirements for academic only students.
- Classroom conduct policies of military customs and courtesies, university policies, and personal preferences for issues such as eating and drinking in class, etc.
- Grading and evaluation procedures. Clearly list each graded item, indicate how much weight each item has been assigned and include the grading scale. Remember attendance must be subordinate to measurable performance based on lesson objectives except when attendance falls below 80%.
- Scheduling Information. Indicate class meeting dates, holidays, and breaks.
- The syllabus should also include a schedule of which lessons will be covered each class.
- Documentation
  - To show you have reviewed the syllabus and checked for all required items, a good idea is to either sign off the syllabi and keep them on file, or use some type of syllabus checklist. If used, store the checklist along with the syllabus in the respective Instructor's Folder.
- Tips
  - Recommend instructors print off a copy of their syllabus and turn it in to you a few weeks before the start of the semester to give yourself time to review & for Det CC signature. Highlight portions of the syllabus when you go through the checklist to show you checked for them. This makes it easy for det assessors to verify required items are included. Use a syllabus template to ensure the inclusion of all required items and to reduce errors.
  - DO NOT reinvent the wheel; there are many complete syllabi and grade books at other detachments. Utilize the ROTC network and get copies from other instructors to aid in development of syllabus.
  - Do not forget a syllabus is required for LLAB, even though it is a Pass/Fail at most dets. The OFC is responsible for this.
  - You can also include the following information: office hours, exam information, writing assignments, homework assignments, lesson descriptions, briefing criteria, and virtually anything that you deem will make your classroom setting clear.
  - Syllabi must be posted for all cadet and students/participants to view, as this is a checklist item.

**TEST CONSTRUCTION EVALUATION**

Each instructor will write his/her own exams. They can select questions from the test bank provided or they can write their own questions. The EO is required to review one exam from each instructor per semester. When reviewing the exams, it is important to check that each instructor uses the stated lesson objectives and samples of behavior as a guide. When writing out each question, the instructor should align the structure and response so it matches the stated objective of that particular lesson.

- Documentation
  - IAW AFROTCI 36- 2011, the EO will review one exam by each instructor per academic semester to assess effectiveness in testing lesson objectives. IAW AFROTCI 36-2011, a master copy of each exam will be maintained until revised.
- Tips
  - Store reviewed exams and master copies of each exam in the respective instructor's folder.

**GRADE BOOK REVIEW**

These are AFROTC requirements for your grade book. Please check with your college or university to ensure that you are also compliant with its overarching guidance.

- At a minimum, each Aerospace course grade book must contain: attendance records, all graded items, points or percentages earned by each student, and final course grade for each student.
- Keep a copy of all instructors' grade books. It is the responsibility of the EO to ensure that this is being accomplished, although the individual duty will fall on the instructor to complete. It will be good for continuity and can be easily accessed during SAVs or det assessments. Recommend maintaining it in the Instructor Folder as well as an overall gradebook folder in a share drive.
- Check your college or university's policy for their required retention period to make sure you comply.
- Check that students who did not meet the attendance standard received a failing grade.
- Check that students who received an "Incomplete" in their AS class or LLAB received the "I" in compliance with host university policy and ensure it is resolved NLT the end of the following term.

**ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND INTEGRITY BRIEF**

IAW AFROTCI 36-2011, ensure all students, staff, and guest speakers are briefed and informed at the beginning of each academic term on Air University's policy regarding Academic Freedom and Academic Integrity. Source documents are AUI 36-2308, Academic Freedom, and AUI 36-2309, Academic Integrity. Briefing materials can be found on [www.holmcenter.com](http://www.holmcenter.com/).

- Brief cadre at first staff meeting of term.
- Brief cadets at first LLAB, both fall and spring.
- Brief guest speaker and document completion prior to the speaking event. The cadet OG/CC or OFC could also be responsible for ensuring this action is completed by guest speakers, as long as the EO is provided the documentation.
  - It is not possible to brief or inform all guest speakers prior to the academic term but it needs to be done prior to the speaking engagement.
- Documentation
  - Document that briefing was given and retain documentation for one year following the briefing.

**UNIVERSITY RELATIONS**

IAW AFROTCI 36-2011, the EO must ensure that course descriptions in catalogs of host institutions and affiliated school campuses are included when practical. That includes all AS Courses and LLAB. Each year, the Holm Center curriculum department will update the curriculum program and post the document on their homepage in a PDF document. This document includes the descriptions for each AS and LLAB.

- Documentation
  - Send out course descriptions to each institution by email to show you made an attempt to have the information included in their course catalog. Print out the pages from the current course catalogs or web pages for those institutions that did include it.
- Tips
  - Depending on how many cross-town schools you are affiliated with, this could be a lengthy process. To save some time:
    - Keep good records of who to submit updates to each year.
    - Many institutions have a specific format the information needs to be submitted in. To save time each year, use the same format as the year prior.
    - The Recruiting Officer can share the task with you.
    - Even if you miss the deadline to get the paper copy of the course catalog updated, most schools can continually update their electronic version at any time.
    - HQ AFROTC developed a standardized paragraph to send to all crosstown schools which links the course descriptions to the host university online catalog, making this process much easier.

**END OF TERM SURVEYS**

The EO is responsible to ensure surveys are conducted as determined by the detachment and/or HQ AFROTC. Even though surveys are optional, instructors need to encourage cadets to complete them so the necessary changes can be made to the curriculum, teaching method/style, etc. EOT surveys include:

- AS Class and LLAB Survey (normally created by detachment)
- University Survey (conducted by University, EO facilitates and collects data once complete)
- Holm Center Curriculum Division End-of-Term Survey (guidance will be provided through ARMS and is usually given at the end of spring term through beginning of summer)
- EO and PAS will review results with assigned faculty members as part of each semester's review.
- Documentation
  - Compile results for each instructor and store in their respective instructor folder. Document any issues identified by survey feedback that need resolution and annotate actions/steps taken to resolve these issues.
- Tips
  - Consider also having a survey of your New Student Orientation. There are many websites that run free survey services, such as [www.surveymonkey.com](http://www.surveymonkey.com/).

**AIR AND SPACE STUDIES MINOR**

If a minor program already exists at your institution, GREAT! Hopefully there is plenty of documentation from the previous EO on managing the program, although it may not be a direct EO function at some dets. Many admin assistants have direct roles in granting the minor with the institution, if already established. If not, your host institution will have documentation of the program and will give you directions on how to be an advisor of a minor program. Typically when a school has a minor program it is open to all students, not just cadets.

- If your detachment does not have a minor established, there is a guide on the Holm Center Site to help you set one up. Check under "Curriculum," then "Faculty Development" for directions to get started.
- Tips
  - Come up with a plan for advertising the minor. Facebook/Instagram is a great advertising tool to target students, especially from your det as a club!
